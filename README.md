# Arduino LED Controller

This project is a RGB LED controller for Arduino UNO R3, using WS2812B LEDs, and it is used in combination with [lights-manager](https://github.com/jgutschon/lights-manager).

## Getting Started

- Install the PlatformIO vscode extension and open the project from the PlatformIO home

## Powershell scripts

The scripts located in `powershell/` are to be used on Windows in the Group Policy Editor in order to automatically turn on and off the lights upon startup/shutdown, otherwise they will always be on.
